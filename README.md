This is everything we do in the Codig Along Evening sessions.

## Part 1: Tracking larval zebrafish

03.VI.2020

We were using a movie from freely swimming larval zebrafish,
and we were looking into ways how to find and track them over time.

## Part 2: Biophysical properties of Nav1.7 - Machine Learning basics

17.VI.2020

We were using electrophysiological recordings of hNav1.7 in voltage clamp mode
to identify biophysical properties of hNav1.7: Activation and Inactivation kinetics.
We used different ways to estimate the reversal potential and fitted linear,
exponential and sigmoid functions. Additionally, we tested our own implementation of gradient descent 
to fit a linear function.
